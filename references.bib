abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} OBJECTIVES: Dropout from substance use disorders treatment is associated with poor outcomes. Although many factors have been associated with an early dropout of patients, the reasons for dropping out of treatment prematurely remain poorly understood particularly in the Indian context. This study was aimed to study socio-demographic and clinical variables predicting initial dropout of patients attending a tertiary care de-addiction treatment centre in north India. METHODS: Information was extracted from the records of consecutive newly registered patients from January 2011 to December 2014. The patients who did not come for follow up within 30 days of the first contact were defined as initial dropouts. RESULTS: Data of 7991 patients could be retrieved. Majority of the sample consisted of male, married and employed individuals. Of them, 4907 patients (61.3{\%}) were considered initial dropouts. Multivariate analysis revealed that after controlling for other factors, greater age, being employed, lower educational status, lesser duration of substance use, use of alcohol, opiate, tobacco, cannabis or sedative-hypnotic use but the absence of multi-substance use predicted initial drop out. INTERPRETATION {\&} CONCLUSIONS: This study identified some socio-demographic and clinical variables which might predict treatment attrition in substance use disorders. Clinician's awareness towards these factors and tailor-made intervention might improve initial treatment retention. Future research could be directed to find the validity of this assumption.},

abstract = {Abstract Background and Aims Relapse rates for psychosocial substance use disorder (SUD) treatments are high, and dropout is a robust predictor of relapse. This study aimed to estimate average dropout rates of in-person psychosocial SUD treatments and to assess predictors of dropout. Design A comprehensive meta-analysis of dropout rates of studies of in-person psychosocial SUD treatment. Studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies. Setting Studies conducted anywhere in the world that examined SUD treatment and were published from 1965 to 2016, inclusive. Participants/cases One hundred and fifty-one studies, 338 study arms and 299 dropout rates including 26 243 participants. Measurements Databases were searched for studies of SUD treatment that included an in-person psychosocial component. Meta-analyses and meta-regressions were conducted to estimate dropout rates and identify predictors of dropout, including participant characteristics, facilitator characteristics and treatment characteristics. Pooled estimates were calculated with random-effects analyses accounting for the hierarchical structure of study arms nested within studies. Findings The average dropout rate across all studies and study arms was 30.4{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 27.2–33.8 and 95{\%} prediction interval (PI) = 6.25–74.15], with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 93.7{\%}, P {\textless} 0.0001). Studies including a higher percentage of African Americans and lower-income individuals were associated with higher dropout rates. At intake, more cigarettes/day and a greater percentage of heroin use days were associated with lower dropout rates, whereas heavier cocaine use was associated with higher dropout rates. Dropout rates were highest for studies targeting cocaine, methamphetamines and major stimulants (broadly defined) and lowest for studies targeting alcohol, tobacco and heroin, although there were few studies on methamphetamines, major stimulants and heroin. Programs characterized by more treatment sessions and greater average session length were associated with higher dropout rates. Facilitator characteristics were not significantly associated with dropout. Conclusions On average, approximately 30{\%} of participants drop out of in-person psychosocial SUD treatment studies, but there is wide variability. Drop-out rates vary with the treated population, the substance being targeted, and the characteristics of the treatment.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a more profound political debate in Latin American countries around the possibilities of legal regulation and decriminalization of currently controlled drugs, particularly cannabis. This debate is a complex one that deals with a growing drug trade towards North America and Europe, as well as oversaturated judicial and health systems across Latin America. Mexico's role in the production and/or distribution of controlled drugs has been recognized for many years, but only recently has Mexico's own problematic use of drugs, especially in the cities of the northern and southern borders, been raised as an issue. Drug policy in Mexico has a long history, which can only be understood in its political and economic contexts and its relations with the United States. Mexican drug policy is stipulated in several legal documents such as the Constitution, the General Health Law and specific Official Mexican Standards, amongst others. In these documents possession, use and sale of drugs are considered illegal, but in case of some drugs like cannabis, cocaine, opium, heroin, MDA, MDMA, Meth (crystal), and LSD, the maximum amount that an individual may possess for personal use is stipulated. Currently, there are controversies in Mexico regarding exempting the use of certain drugs (especially cannabis) for medical indications as well as increasing the maximum amounts under which possession is deemed for personal use whilst reducing the penalty in case of personal use in small doses.},

Specifically, this study is interested in evaluating the reliability, consistency and concurrent and discriminant validity of this instrument. The sample was composed for a total of 400 people from four different settings: treatment centers (residential and ambulatories), primary health care, police stations and companies. The reliability of the ASSIST was high ({\&}{\#}945; = .86 for Alcohol, {\&}{\#}945; = .84 for marijuana and {\&}{\#}945; = .90 for cocaine). The intra class correlation coefficient (ICC) with test-retest comparison was statistically significant for Alcohol (ICC = .66), marijuana (ICC = .74) and cocaine (ICC = .80). There were statistically significant correlations between the ASSIST and the AUDIT score (Pearson s r = .85), the ASSIST and the ASI-Lite score (r between .66 and .83 for tobacco, alcohol, marijuana and cocaine), and the ASSIST and the SDS score (r = .65). The original cutoff point for high risk detection was 27 points, however, in order to have a better balance between sensitivity and specificity the cut was changed to 21 points. The ASSIST presents good psychometric properties and therefore is a reliable and valid instrument to be used as a mechanism to detect risk levels of substance use in the Chilean population.},

abstract = {Childhood abuse, neglect, and loss are common in psychiatric patients, and the relationship between childhood adversity and adult mental illness is well known. However, beyond diagnoses that are specifically trauma-related, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, there has been little research on how childhood adversity contributes to complex presentations that require more intensive treatment. We examined the relationship between childhood adversity and other contributors to clinical complexity in adult outpatients seeking mental health assessment. In a cross-sectional study, patients completed standard measures of psychological distress and functional impairment. Psychiatrists completed an inventory of clinical complexity, which included childhood abuse, neglect, and loss. Of 4,903 patients seen over 15 months, 1,315 (27{\%}) both consented to research and had the measure of complexity completed. Childhood abuse or neglect was identified in 474 (36.0{\%}) and significant childhood loss in 236 (17.9{\%}). Correcting for multiple comparisons and controlling for psychiatric diagnosis, age, and sex, patients with childhood abuse or neglect were significantly more likely to also have 11 of 31 other indices of clinical complexity, with odds ratios ranging from 1.7 to 5.0. Both childhood abuse or neglect and childhood loss were associated with greater overall complexity (i.e., more indices of complexity, ?2 = 136 and 38 respectively, each p {\textless} .001). Childhood abuse and neglect (but not childhood loss) were significantly associated with psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale [K10] score, F = 6.2, p = .01) and disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale 2.0 [WHODAS 2.0] score, F = 5.0, p = .03). Childhood abuse and neglect were associated with many characteristics that contribute to clinical complexity, and thus to suboptimal outcomes to standard, guideline-based care. Screening may alert psychiatrists to the need for intensive, patient-centered, and trauma-informed treatments. Identifying childhood adversity as a common antecedent of complexity may facilitate developing transdiagnostic programs that specifically target sources of complexity.},

abstract = {There are many ways of interpreting the behaviours related to substance misuse and addiction, which can be sort out as three basic models: biomedical, legal, and social. They are corresponding to approaches built in different epistemic and professional frameworks, such as medicine, law, and social work. Confronted with the experience of addiction, these models appear as pre-determined by a specific scientific or professional ideology; they presuppose a pre-understanding of the phenomena. I directed, therefore, my investigation on those phenomenological paths that might lead to, and circumscribe the experience of addiction and I propose an analytical framework based on three major phenomenological perspectives: descriptive, genetic, and inter-relational. This paper argues in favour of defining addiction without making reference to a form of failure, psycho-somatic or existential. On the contrary, it concludes that there is a need to adopt a definition of addiction which holds at its core the idea of empowering addicted persons, of re-constructing their capacity to take decisions about their own lives.},

abstract = {Crack cocaine users frequently report difficulties regarding having healthy and rewarding relationships. Factors other than the use of crack cocaine itself may be at play when it comes to being able to develop healthier connections with partners, adult relatives and close friends. To verify which factors, including demographics, substance abuse related factors and psychiatric comorbidities could be markers for a higher severity of problems in interpersonal relationships of crack cocaine users seeking for treatment. This was a cross-sectional study, conducted between April 2011 and November 2012. Participants were 407 crack cocaine users seeking treatment in specialized public facilities of six Brazilian capitals. The relationship of severity of problems in the family/social area and the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, exposure to stressful events, substance use related factors and practice of illicit activities were explored through multivariate analyses. Number of days using crack cocaine in the last 30 days, age of first time using alcohol and feeling its effects, a diagnosis of alcohol abuse, posttraumatic stress disorder, antisocial personality disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were significantly associated with a higher severity of problems in interpersonal relationships with partners, adult relatives and friends. Problems in interpersonal relationships are strongly related to specific psychiatric comorbidities and the frequency of crack cocaine use. Factors identified by this study can make the paths to recovery more challenging. These results support psychosocial interventions that focus in the improvement of interpersonal relationships of crack cocaine users.},

abstract = {Across the addictions field, the primary outcome in treatment research has been reduction in drug consumption. A comprehensive view of the impact of substance use disorders on human functioning suggests that effective treatments should address the many consequences and features of addiction beyond drug use, a recommendation forwarded by multiple expert panels and review papers. Despite recurring proposals, and a compelling general rationale for moving beyond drug use as the sole standard for evaluating addiction treatment, the field has yet to adopt any core set of 'other' measures that are routinely incorporated into treatment research. Among the many reasons for the limited impact of previous proposals has been the absence of a clear set of guidelines for selecting candidate outcomes. This paper is the result of the deliberations of a panel of substance abuse treatment and research experts convened by the National Institute on Drug Abuse to discuss appropriate outcome measures for clinical trials of substance abuse treatments. This paper provides an overview of previous recommendations and outlines specific guidelines for consideration of candidate outcomes. A list of outcomes meeting those guidelines is described and illustrated in detail with two outcomes: craving and quality of life. The paper concludes with specific recommendations for moving beyond the outcome listing offered in this paper to promote the programmatic incorporation of these outcomes into treatment research.},

abstract = {Women-specific factors exist that increases vulnerability to drug-related harms from injection drug use, including blood-borne viruses (BBVs), but gender-based differences in BBV prevalence have not been systematically examined.We conducted meta-analyses to estimate country, regional, and global prevalence of serologically confirmed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV; based on detection of anti-HCV antibody), and hepatitis B virus (HBV; based on detection of HBV surface antigen) in people who inject drugs (PWID), by gender. Gender-based differences in the BBV prevalence (calculated as the risk among women relative to the risk among men) were regressed on country-level prevalence and inequality measures (Gender inequality index, Human development index, Gini coefficient, and high, low or middle income of the country).Gender-based differences varied by countries and regions. HIV prevalence was higher among women than men in sub-Saharan Africa (relative risk [RR], 2.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.8–4.4) and South Asia (RR, 1.7; 95{\%} CI, 1.1–2.7); anti-HCV was lower among women in the Middle East and North Africa (RR, 0.6; 95{\%} CI, .5–.7) and East and Southeast Asia (RR, 0.8; 95{\%} CI, .7–.9). Gender-based differences varied with country-levels of the BBV prevalence in the general population, human development, and income distribution.HIV was more prevalent in women who inject drugs as compared to their male counterparts in some countries, but there is variation between and within regions. In countries where women are at higher risks, there is a need to develop gender-sensitive harm-reduction services for the particularly marginalized population of women who inject drugs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Religious coping, one of the most widely studied components of spirituality among psychiatric populations, has rarely been addressed in patients with severe substance use disorders (SUD). The aim of our study was to elucidate whether religious coping is related to symptom expression and mutual-help participation. METHODS: Self-reported religious coping was assessed in individuals sequentially admitted to a private psychiatric hospital for inpatient detoxification. Target symptoms of SUD included severity of substance use prior to admission and craving during detoxification. Three hundred thirty-one patients (68.6{\%} male) participated in the survey; mean age was 38.0 years, and primary presenting diagnosis was most commonly alcohol use disorder (n = 202; 61{\%}), followed by opioid use disorder (n = 119; 36{\%}). RESULTS: Positive religious coping was associated with significantly greater mutual-help participation, fewer days of drug use prior to admission, and was modestly, yet significantly associated with lower drug craving. Negative religious coping was associated with lower confidence in the ability to remain abstinent post-discharge and higher drug craving. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with hypotheses, greater positive religious coping was associated with greater mutual-help participation, lower severity of pre-admission drug use, and lower substance craving during detoxification. Use of positive religious coping may modify the course of SUD recovery by promoting engagement in mutual-help activities. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of this study suggest that positive and negative religious coping are linked with several key SUD recovery variables. Further research to replicate this finding and to assess mechanisms within this potential association is warranted. (Am J Addict 2017;26:744-750).},

@article{Hildebrandt2017,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The type A/B classification model for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) has received considerable empirical support. However, few studies examine the underlying latent structure of this subtyping model, which has been challenged as a dichotomization of a single drinking severity dimension. Type B, relative to type A, alcoholics represent those with early age of onset, greater familial risk, and worse outcomes from alcohol use. METHODS: We examined the latent structure of the type A/B model using categorical, dimensional, and factor mixture models in a mixed-gender community treatment-seeking sample of adults with an AUD. RESULTS: Factor analytic models identified 2 factors (drinking severity/externalizing psychopathology and internalizing psychopathology) underlying the type A/B indicators. A factor mixture model with 2 dimensions and 3 classes emerged as the best overall fitting model. The classes reflected a type A class and 2 type B classes (B1 and B2) that differed on the respective level of drinking severity/externalizing pathology and internalizing pathology. Type B1 had a greater prevalence of women and more internalizing pathology and B2 had a greater prevalence of men and more drinking severity/externalizing pathology. The 2-factor, 3-class model also exhibited predictive validity by explaining significant variance in 12-month drinking and drug use outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The model identified in this study may provide a basis for examining different sources of heterogeneity in the course and outcome of AUDs.},

abstract = {Background: The current study aimed at determining the pattern of drug dependence and its related factors in mid-term residential treatment centers (MTRCs). Methods: The current cross-sectional study was conducted on all drug dependent people residing in MTRCs of Tehran, Iran, who were voluntarily seeking treatment from April to August, 2018. Required data were collected through face-to-face interviews. Drug dependence was categorized into four groups: soft opioids, hard opioids, methamphetamine, and combination of hard opioids and methamphetamine. The association of potential risk factors with drug dependence was measured using chi-square test and multinomial logistic regression. Results: Out of 1868 participants in the current study, 97{\%} were male. Mean age (SD) of the participants was 38.1 (9.9). The different types of drug dependence were hard opioids (43.0{\%}),soft opioids (29.5{\%}), methamphetamine (15.4{\%}), and a combination of hard opioids and methamphetamine (12.1{\%}). The prevalence of injecting drug use was 2.7{\%}. In comparison with the reference group (soft opioids), being un-married and unemployment, significantly increased the risk of using the three groups of drugs (odds ratios [ORs]: 1.5-3.34, P values: {\textless}0.001-0.033).Age ≥30 years at the initiation of drug use, and using current drug for more than 10 years, significantly increased the risk of using hard opioids and a combination of hard opioids and methamphetamine (ORs: 1.65-2.31, P values: {\textless}0.001-0.030). Age ≥50 years significantly decreased the risk of using the three groups of drugs (ORs: 0.21-0.43, P≤0.001). Conclusion: Different pattern of drug dependence found in MTRCs, they were mostly hard opioid users, lower injecting drug use and higher mean of age.},

Method : In this correlation study, Temperament and Character Inventory, Addiction Severity Index, Aggression Subscale of MMPI-2, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale, Emotional Schema Questionnaire, and Psychosocial Checklist were used for data collection. Results: The cluster analysis of 324 individuals with substance use disorder explored 4 subtypes. Subgroups were named based on the main features as emotionally distressed, constitutional, nonconformist, and impulsive. Significant differences were found among groups in emotional schemas, history of mental disorder in the family, rate of relapse, and history of imprisonment.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among the adult population worldwide, about 0.5{\%} has illicit drug use disorder (DUD) and about 5{\%} has alcohol use disorder (AUD). Dependency on alcohol, medication or illicit drugs are recognised as risk factors for disabling disease and early death. Treatment for substance use disorders (SUD) is important in promoting persistent abstinence and may be perceived as a valuable public health measure. The current systematic review aims at exploring how psychosocial factors connected to recovery capital and coping behaviour, change after inpatient SUD treatment. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in Campbell Collaboration Library, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Epistemonikos, Medline, PsychINFO, Social Sciences Citation Index and SocINDEX. Cohort studies on psychosocial outcomes for adults who had attended to inpatient SUD treatment that exceeds 3 months, were included. The outcome of interest was change in psychosocial factors. The search results were identified as include, exclude or unclear by one author and then screened by the second author with a specific focus on studies recognised as unclear. Diverging evaluations of eligibility among the unclear studies were resolved by discussion. In case of disagreement, the third author decided the eligibility of the studies in question. RESULTS: Findings imply an overall progress in mental health, and a potential improvement in employment status and perceived social support after inpatient SUD treatment. Additionally, findings indicate a decrease in substance use from admission to follow-up after discharge from inpatient SUD treatment. These findings are consistent with earlier research on important factors in recovering from SUD. Findings on change in self-efficacy, housing, education and Quality of Life (QoL) however, were scantly researched and were expected to be more prominent outcomes of interest among the included studies. CONCLUSION: Due to the substantial resources used to provide SUD treatment, knowledge about recovery capital, like psychosocial factors that facilitate coping behaviour and reintegration to society, should be standardised and used by SUD treatment providers.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug use can lead to several psychological, medical and social complications. The current study aimed to measure and decomposes socioeconomic-related inequalities in drug use among adults in Iran. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study The PERSIAN Cohort is the largest and most important cohort among 18 distinct areas of Iran. This study was conducted on 130,570 adults 35 years and older. A structured questionnaire was applied to collect data. The concentration index (C) was used to quantify and decompose socioeconomic inequalities in drug use. RESULTS: The prevalence experience of drug use was 11.9{\%}. The estimated C for drug use was - 0.021. The corresponding value of the C for women and men were - 0.171 and - 0.134, respectively. The negative values of the C suggest that drug use is more concentrated among the population with low socioeconomic status in Iran (p {\textless} 0.001). For women, socioeconomic status (SES) (26.37{\%}), province residence (- 22.38{\%}) and age (9.76{\%}) had the most significant contribution to socioeconomic inequality in drug use, respectively. For men, SES (80.04{\%}), smoking (32.04{\%}) and alcohol consumption (- 12.37{\%}) were the main contributors to socioeconomic inequality in drug use. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that drug use prevention programs in Iran should focus on socioeconomically disadvantaged population. Our finding could be useful for health policy maker to design and implement effective preventative programs to protect Iranian population against the drug use.},

abstract = {In 1977, the American pathologist and psychiatrist George Engel (1913-1999) published in the Journal Science his paper "TheIn 1977, the American pathologist and psychiatrist George Engel (1913-1999) published in the Journal Science his paper "Theneed for a new medical model: A challenge for biomedicine", introducing the term Biopsychosocial Model. This model basedon the results of Engel's studies in ulcerative colitis, depression and psychogenic pain, constituted a challenge for biomedicineand the biomedical model. The basic principles of the model included the biological, psychological and social dimensions of the person's life and theperception that the person suffers as a whole and not as isolated organs. The doctor should use a holistic approach regardingillness and should consider his/her relation with the patient socially equal. The personality and the emotional reserves of thepatient, as well as the particular environmental conditions in which the person lives in should be taken into account. There is no doubt that the biopsychosocial model has established a more empathetic and compassionate approach in medical practice. Already since 1936, the general adaptation syndrome had been proposed by the Austrian-Canadian endocrinologist HansSeley (1907-1982), who emphasized that psychological stressful factors may have injurious consequences on health, while theresponse systems to stress may be dysregulated not only by genetic factors, but also from experiences and stressful life events,as well as by harmful behaviors such as smoking, alcohol consumption and lack of physical exercise. Psychosocial factors may co-determine the patient's vulnerability and the illness's severity and course. The biopsychosocialmodel consider the interactions with genetic susceptibility, personality, stressful events and, generally, with the patient's socialcontext. Environmental factors increase the probability of the clinical expression of a mental disorder, play a role in the time ofonset of an illness's manifestation, and they can also protect a vulnerable person from the disease. Stressful experiences modify immunological response and influence treatment compliance. Non adherence to pharmacotherapy,as well as to the psychosocial interventions, may cause defective recovery of psychosocial functioning, recurrence ofthe disorder, as well as insufficient use of health resources and a higher health care cost. The psychoeducation of patients andtheir relatives by the application of the biopsychosocial model plays an important role in psychiatric therapeutics, and it mayalso be used via Internet in the frame of telepsychiatry. Results from neuroimaging studies have shown that the different kinds of human experiences, traumatic or therapeutic, havemeasurable influences on the brain function. Psychotherapy may modify the neuronal connections of the brain in the frame ofits plasticity, as was found by the discovery of synaptogenesis in response to learning and can, thus, be considered not only as astrictly psychological but also as a biopsychosocial form of treatment. Among the disadvantages of the biopsychosocial model have been reported the lack of a concise theoretical frameworkregarding its function and content, that it is complicated, difficulties in its coordination and assignment of responsibilities, aswell as problems with the education on it being multifaceted. The biopsychosocial model has been criticized that it does notconstitute a scientific or philosophical model, it does not provide an answer to the crucial question of how the biological, psychologicaland social variables interact in the disease's expression, that it does not provide guidance on the exact time of itsapplication and, finally, that it allows for a wide range of interventions without providing specific guidelines of a concrete therapeutic scheme. The person-centered diagnosis is based on the biopsychosocial model, connects science with humanism and uses all thepossible ways so that the clinicians, the patients and their families collaborate for a more effective management of the disease.This approach has been established by the World Psychiatric Association (WPA, 2007) as the program "Psychiatry for the Person". Psychiatry in everyday practice presents particularities versus other medical disciplines due to the complexity and polymorphismPsychiatry in everyday practice presents particularities versus other medical disciplines due to the complexity and polymorphismof the expression of mental disorders, their close relation to psychosocial factors, the lack of explicit pathognomonicelements and the stigmatization of mental illness. For these reasons, the biopsychosocial model is particularly applicable inpsychiatric disorders, but it should not be over looked also in somatic illnesses. The biopsychosocial model, despite the criticism it was subjected to, continues to offer valuable clinical, educational andresearch services, as well as to provide an important contribution to the formation of health policies, not only for psychiatry, butfor the whole of medicine as well.},

abstract = {Background Non-fatal outcomes of disease and injury increasingly detract from the ability of the world's population to live in full health, a trend largely attributable to an epidemiological transition in many countries from causes affecting children, to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) more common in adults. For the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we estimated the incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for diseases and injuries at the global, regional, and national scale over the period of 1990 to 2015. Methods We estimated incidence and prevalence by age, sex, cause, year, and geography with a wide range of updated and standardised analytical procedures. Improvements from GBD 2013 included the addition of new data sources, updates to literature reviews for 85 causes, and the identification and inclusion of additional studies published up to November, 2015, to expand the database used for estimation of non-fatal outcomes to 60 900 unique data sources. Prevalence and incidence by cause and sequelae were determined with DisMod-MR 2.1, an improved version of the DisMod-MR Bayesian meta-regression tool first developed for GBD 2010 and GBD 2013. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies where the complexity of the disease was not suited to DisMod-MR 2.1 or where incidence and prevalence needed to be determined from other data. For GBD 2015 we created a summary indicator that combines measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility (the Socio-demographic Index [SDI]) and used it to compare observed patterns of health loss to the expected pattern for countries or locations with similar SDI scores. Findings We generated 9{\textperiodcentered}3 billion estimates from the various combinations of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for causes, sequelae, and impairments by age, sex, geography, and year. In 2015, two causes had acute incidences in excess of 1 billion: upper respiratory infections (17{\textperiodcentered}2 billion, 95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 15{\textperiodcentered}4–19{\textperiodcentered}2 billion) and diarrhoeal diseases (2{\textperiodcentered}39 billion, 2{\textperiodcentered}30–2{\textperiodcentered}50 billion). Eight causes of chronic disease and injury each affected more than 10{\%} of the world's population in 2015: permanent caries, tension-type headache, iron-deficiency anaemia, age-related and other hearing loss, migraine, genital herpes, refraction and accommodation disorders, and ascariasis. The impairment that affected the greatest number of people in 2015 was anaemia, with 2{\textperiodcentered}36 billion (2{\textperiodcentered}35–2{\textperiodcentered}37 billion) individuals affected. The second and third leading impairments by number of individuals affected were hearing loss and vision loss, respectively. Between 2005 and 2015, there was little change in the leading causes of years lived with disability (YLDs) on a global basis. NCDs accounted for 18 of the leading 20 causes of age-standardised YLDs on a global scale. Where rates were decreasing, the rate of decrease for YLDs was slower than that of years of life lost (YLLs) for nearly every cause included in our analysis. For low SDI geographies, Group 1 causes typically accounted for 20–30{\%} of total disability, largely attributable to nutritional deficiencies, malaria, neglected tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. Lower back and neck pain was the leading global cause of disability in 2015 in most countries. The leading cause was sense organ disorders in 22 countries in Asia and Africa and one in central Latin America; diabetes in four countries in Oceania; HIV/AIDS in three southern sub-Saharan African countries; collective violence and legal intervention in two north African and Middle Eastern countries; iron-deficiency anaemia in Somalia and Venezuela; depression in Uganda; onchoceriasis in Liberia; and other neglected tropical diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is increasing the number of people living with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Shifts in the epidemiological profile driven by socioeconomic change also contribute to the continued increase in years lived with disability (YLDs) as well as the rate of increase in YLDs. Despite limitations imposed by gaps in data availability and the variable quality of the data available, the standardised and comprehensive approach of the GBD study provides opportunities to examine broad trends, compare those trends between countries or subnational geographies, benchmark against locations at similar stages of development, and gauge the strength or weakness of the estimates available.

abstract = {Reliability is usually estimated for a test score, but it can also be estimated for item scores. Item-score reliability can be useful to assess the item's contribution to the test score's reliability, for identifying unreliable scores in aberrant item-score patterns in person-fit analysis, and for selecting the most reliable item from a test to use as a single-item measure. Four methods were discussed for estimating item-score reliability: the Molenaar–Sijtsma method (method MS), Guttman's method (Formula presented.), the latent class reliability coefficient (method LCRC), and the correction for attenuation (method CA). A simulation study was used to compare the methods with respect to median bias, variability (interquartile range [IQR]), and percentage of outliers. The simulation study consisted of six conditions: standard, polytomous items, unequal (Formula presented.) parameters, two-dimensional data, long test, and small sample size. Methods MS and CA were the most accurate. Method LCRC showed almost unbiased results, but large variability. Method (Formula presented.) consistently underestimated item-score reliabilty, but showed a smaller IQR than the other methods.},

abstract = {This study aims to psychometrically validate the Chilean version of the treatment outcomes profile (TOP), an instrument that can be used by treatment centers to monitor the results of drug and alcohol treatments. Specifically, this study is interested in evaluating the inter-rater reliability, concurrent validity, change sensitivity and discriminant and construct validity of this instrument. The TOP was modified to reflect the Chilean context and then applied in three successive stages: an initial application at the beginning of treatment, a retest after 1. week, and a follow up after a month. The sample was composed of 411 users of different types of drugs who were in treatment centers in the three largest regions of the country. The TOP reliability was greater than .75 for most items. Regarding concurrent validity, all the coefficients were in the expected direction and statistically significant. Change over time, as measured by Cohen's d statistic and the Reliable Change Index, was significant for most items. Users in treatment for less than 3. months showed higher alcohol consumption (odds ratio [OR]. =. 1.07; 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI]: 1.01-1.13), poorer psychological health (OR. =. 0.94; 95{\%} CI: 0.87-1.00), fewer days worked (0.56; 0.95-0.99) and poorer housing conditions (OR. =. 2.76; 95{\%} CI: 1.22-6.23) than did their counterparts who had more than 3. months of treatment. Researchers extracted six components with eigenvalues greater than one, accounting for 69.0{\%} of the total variance. In general, the Chilean TOP is a reliable and valid mechanism to monitor outcomes of people treated for problems with drug and alcohol abuse in Chile, but further validation work is required in some dimensions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) includes a comprehensive assessment of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 354 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data. METHODS: We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68 781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting. FINDINGS: Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 3{\textperiodcentered}1-4{\textperiodcentered}6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7{\textperiodcentered}2{\%} (6{\textperiodcentered}0-8{\textperiodcentered}4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421-723) to 853 million (642-1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7{\textperiodcentered}9{\%} (6{\textperiodcentered}6-9{\textperiodcentered}2) for males and 6{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} (5{\textperiodcentered}4-7{\textperiodcentered}7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95{\%} UI 2782-3252] per 100 000 in males vs s1400 [1279-1524] per 100 000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082-3583] vs 2336 [2154-2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943-3630] vs 5643 [5057-6302]). INTERPRETATION: Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury.

abstract = {Background The HIV care cascade has improved in Latin America over the last decade. However, the influence of alcohol and noninjected drug use (NIDU) on cascade outcomes is mostly unknown. This study estimated the association of alcohol and NIDU with retention in care, loss to follow up (LTFU), and virologic failure (VF). Methods Individuals 18 years attending routine HIV clinic visits and completing the Rapid Screening Tool (RST; evaluating NIDU and ART adherence in 7-day recall period) during 2012–13 were followed up to 2015 in the Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated for the association of alcohol consumption and NIDU with retention in care by logistic regression; adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated for the associations with LTFU and VF by Cox regression. Results Among 3604 individuals, the proportions retained in care for one year were 84{\%}, 79{\%}, 72{\%}, and 69{\%} for patients reporting non-use, alcohol use, NIDU, and both alcohol and NIDU, respectively. For the same patient groups, the proportions LTFU over 18 months were 6{\%}, 8{\%}, 12{\%}, and 13{\%}, respectively. There were 1901 patients (53{\%}) with HIV RNA results; VF proportions were similar between users and nonusers (ranging from 14–16{\%}). After controlling for age, sex, study site, HIV transmission mode, time on ART, AIDS status, and CD4 count, neither alcohol use (aOR = 1.1, CI = 0.9–1.4; aHR = 1.0, CI = 0.8–1.3) nor NIDU (aOR = 1.3, CI = 0.9–1.8; aHR = 1.4, CI = 0.9–2.1) were significantly associated with retention or VF, respectively. However, both alcohol use (aHR = 1.2, CI = 1.02–1.4) and NIDU (aHR = 1.3, CI = 1.00–1.8) were associated with increased LTFU. Conclusion Alcohol use and NIDU in a 7-day recall period increased the risk of being LTFU during the next 18 months, highlighting the need for routine screening and targeted interventions to keep these individuals in care and on ART.},
